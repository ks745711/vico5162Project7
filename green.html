    <p class="card-text">Mr. John Green, indicated by the green pawn, is a smooth talker. His family is made up of shysters. His dad is a lowdown thief and his mom tells fortunes wherever and whenever she can. Guess what: she's not a psychic. Mr. Green found a calling in spirituality. This means he sets up traveling tents and asks people to give him money which is for the less fortunate, and that means the money is for him. During his travels, "Reverend" Green met and had certain dealings with Mr. Boddy. Did Mr. Boddy have something on the Reverend?</p>
